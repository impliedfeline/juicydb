What did I do:
- 17.3. readings and related articles (2 hours)
How did the development progress;
- No progress this week
What did I learn:
- Mostly about the history of databases, actually. Relational databases reign
  supreme and the problems with using JSON as a general purpose hierarchical
  format as has been fashionable these past years were originally foreseen back
  in the mid 2000s with the advent of XML, or the usage of XML data format for
  databases.
Problems:
- Didn't really have much time to work on the project this week, next week I'm
  expecting a lot of "free" time however.
What's next:
- Whatever I was supposed to do this week, as well as setting up code coverage.
- Probably won't have time to implement key data structures/algorithms next
  week, but I'm aiming for a mostly working application. The week after, I'll
  begin implementing data structures and algorithms myself.
