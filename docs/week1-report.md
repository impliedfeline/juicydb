What did I do:
- read the course pages, in particular the page on documentation (~30 minutes)
- wrote a specification document for the project (~45 minutes)

What did I learn:
- that Oracle Database is the most popular database management system

What's next:
- implementing a rudimentary lexer/parser for a subset of SQL (most important
  queries for prototyping will be SELECT and INSERT INTO)
- evaluating options for the serialization of data
- reading through materials for ideas
